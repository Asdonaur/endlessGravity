# Endless Gravity
This is the first game I published in 2021.

It was for a game development event called "Mejorando Ando", which, in short terms, was pretty much a monthly gamejam.
The event is not active anymore, but the games developed for it still exist :D

Playable version: https://asdonaur.itch.io/endless-gravity
